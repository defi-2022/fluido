# Fluido finance

Project submision for the `Theta hackathon`.

## Inspiration

I've joined this hackathon with mission to grow DeFi ecosystem on `Theta Network`.
My first idea was to create and Lending and Borrowing protocol, the core piece of DeFi lego.
Soon I realised that Theta is missing the critical DeFi protocol, which is `simple` and `transparent` Decentraliezd Exchange.

In order for developers to grow and build new DeFi protocols they need to have an access to:

- addresses of deployed contracts
- contract interfaces
- open source code base
- clear overview of an system architecture

## What is Fluido

`Fluido finance` is a transparent, developer friendly Decentralized Exchange. It solves all of the above problems, furthermore it gives new `yield farming` incentives for investors.

This protocol aims to become the building block for the more advanced DeFi applications.

## How does it work / smart contract architecture

### Frontend

Just for this application we created a new user interface. It aims to be simple an intuitive for both users and developers.

### Smart contracts

`Fluido` uses battle-tested, audited and well known `Uniswap V2` smart contracts deployed on the `Theta Network`.
These contracts are well-know among developers on other chains.
By utilizing these contracts we can quickly onboard new builders.
